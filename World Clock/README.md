## Instructions

### 1. **File Structure**
Since the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all in the same file, you may need to adjust the structure to fit your environment if you're embedding this in a platform like SharePoint.

- **Class Names**: Depending on your environment, certain class names or ID selectors may need to be renamed to avoid conflicts.
- **File Organization**: If your platform requires separating the CSS and JavaScript into different files, youâ€™ll need to extract the appropriate sections from the single file provided.

### 2. **Customization**
- **Time Zones**: You can add or remove time zones by editing the JavaScript section.
- **Styles**: Feel free to modify the CSS to match your design needs or branding.
- **Daylight Saving Time**: The clock automatically adjusts for DST based on the time zone configuration.

### 3. **Compatibility with SharePoint**
If you are embedding this in a SharePoint page:
- Ensure your script runs within a Script Editor or Content Editor Web Part.
- If class names or specific tags conflict with your SharePoint theme, you may need to rename them.
